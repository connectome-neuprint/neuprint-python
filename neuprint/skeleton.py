def heal_skeleton(skeleton_df, max_distance=np.inf):
    """
    Attempt to repair a fragmented skeleton into a single connected component.

    Rather than a single tree, skeletons from neuprint sometimes
    consist of multiple fragments, i.e. multiple connected
    components.  That's due to artifacts in the underlying
    segmentation from which the skeletons were generated.
    In such skeletons, there will be multiple 'root' nodes
    (SWC rows where ``link == -1``).

    This function 'heals' a fragmented skeleton by joining its
    fragments into a single tree.

    First, each fragment is joined to every other fragment at
    their nearest points. The resulting graph has unnecessary
    edges, which are then removed by extracting the minimum
    spanning tree.  The MST is returned as the healed skeleton.

        skeleton_df:
            DataFrame as returned by :py:meth:`.Client.fetch_skeleton()`

        max_distance:
            If a skeleton's fragments are very spatially distant, it may
            not be desirable to connect them with a new edge.
            This parameter specifies the maximum length of new edges
            introduced by the healing procedure.  If a skeleton fragment
            cannot be connected to the rest of the skeleton because it's
            too far away, the skeleton will remain fragmented.
